href=\"http://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/shaquille-oneal-steady-adam-roseman-financial-app-fintech-gig-work-income.html\"><b> O'Neal</b></a> knows what you're thinking. You see him on the cover of this magazine-- wearing a suit, looking dapper and professional--and as much as you like him, you're also groaning a little bit. Another <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/why-nba-superstar-draymond-green-always-wants-to-be-dumbest-person-in-room-and-how-that-approach-could-someday-make-him-a-billionaire.html\">superstar athlete</a> presenting himself as a business genius. It is, after all, fashionable among athletes to parlay one's sports dominance into a global conglomerate, to show that one is as preternaturally gifted in the boardroom as on the basketball court. It's almost obligatory at this point.</p>\r\n<p>But do you really believe it? Maybe you think O'Neal just needs something to do with his time. He's a brand name: He'll do some endorsements, and, hey, good for him. But a serious entrepreneur? <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/graham-winfrey/how-this-tiny-company-is-making-millions-throwing-super-bowl-parties-for-shaq-gronk-and-guy-fieri.html\">Shaq</a>? The guy from Fu-Schnickens? Come on.</p>\r\n<p>O'Neal knows you think this. He might even agree with you.</p>\r\n<p>\"I'm not the smartest guy in the room,\" he tells me, once, twice, a total of 11 times over the span of our conversations. \"I'm not coming in here telling people what to do. I'm not trying to run a business. I'm not an investment guy. When I was younger, I would put a million in something and get nothing back. It was just gone. I knew I had a lot to learn. I still do.\"</p>\r\n<p>This has been O'Neal's thing for decades: Even though he is a 7'1\", 300-plus pound basketball Hall of Famer and one of the most recognizable humans on the planet, he insists that he is just like the rest of us--no better, no worse.</p>\r\n<p>And to be sure, O'Neal's approach to business, at least until recently, has looked like a holdover from an earlier era of celebrity business that was rooted in sponsorships, endorsements, and licensing deals. But a new model has appeared in recent years--led by LeBron James and carried forward by Kevin Durant, Patrick Mahomes, and others--that's less about being a smiling pitchman and more about building empires. Durant's venture-capital firm, 35 Ventures, was one of the earliest investors in Postmates and Coinbase. James's production company, SpringHill, has a $725 million valuation. The conventional wisdom holds that O'Neal, by comparison, is just cashing checks.</p>\r\n<p>But then you take a closer look. Con&shy;sider the sheer number of companies that O'Neal owns a piece of, often a substantial one: Papa Johns, Five Guys, Krispy Kreme, Auntie Anne's. The connected doorbell company Ring, well before Amazon acquired it in 2018 for north of $1 billion. Even Google, all the way back in 1999, long before its IPO, when it was valued at only $100 million. (Guess he didn't lose it all on that one.) O'Neal has opened more than a hundred franchises--car washes, health clubs, restaurants--around the country. He founded a film production company, Jersey Legends, and won an Oscar with a documentary about women's basketball great Lusia Harris. He founded a marketing agency called Majority that has created campaigns for clients including Sprite, GM, and the CDC.</p>\r\n<!--inlineimage//-->\r\n<p>There's more--and how he even remembers them all is downright Clintonian. Among O'Neal's most ambitious ventures has been helping turn Authentic Brands Group--a holding company that before O'Neal arrived in 2015 was mostly known for representing the estates of deceased celebrities such as Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe--into a global player. The firm now owns some 50 major brands, including Brooks Brothers, Sports Illus&shy;trated, A&eacute;ropostale, and Reebok (the last of which it acquired explicitly at O'Neal's behest). His biggest success, or at least his most promising one, has been Big Chicken, a fast-food chain that he founded in Las Vegas and has now expanded to 14 stores in 7 states, and will open four more this quarter alone. (That's not including the Big Chicken restaurants that have opened on all Carnival Cruise Line ships.)</p>\r\n<div class=\"pullquote\">When you talk to people smarter than you, it enhances your intelligence. I do things with people I like who are smart. It's not complicated.</div>\r\n<p>O'Neal's estimated net worth, $400 million, makes him one of the world's wealthiest athletes. And his doctorate from Miami's Barry University (dissertation: \"How Leaders Utilize Humor or Seriousness in Leadership Styles\") makes him one of the most underestimated. \"The guy has a sixth sense,\" says Jamie Salter, CEO of Authentic Brands Group. \"Give me 10 more just like him.\"</p>\r\n<p>O'Neal dismisses such talk about being gifted, or having a unifying theory of business. \"I just want to learn,\" he says. \"It's very simple. When you talk to people smarter than you, it enhances your intelligence. I do things with people I like who are smart. It's not complicated. I don't know why people make it so complicated.\"</p>\r\n<p>And while it's true that he may not be poring over every line on a balance sheet, O'Neal is more intentional in his work than he would like you to believe. In fact, his business philosophy is remarkably consistent, despite a wild variety of ventures. It's a way of thinking about opportunities and leadership that holds lessons that are applicable to everyone, even those who do not rise to 85 inches above the earth.</p>\r\n<h2>Follow your heart</h2>\r\n<p>Every person who has dealt with O'Neal declares some variation of the same thing: He's like a big kid. Four different people told me tales about him pouring his frame into some sort of undersize vehicle and driving it through a crowd of shocked and delighted onlookers. His relentlessly playful attitude was a staple of his playing career as well; more than a couple of his coaches memorably groused about it.</p>\r\n<!--inlineimage//-->\r\n<p>O'Neal is incapable of being anyone other than himself--and while that could have been a limitation, he has turned it into a strength. There is no clear motif among his business interests, no through line other than his involvement. What he brings to them is passion--a genuine drive to be involved. \"I've got a routine with this stuff,\" O'Neal says. \"Any company I start or get involved with, I've got to have three things. First, I've got to have a real interest in the product. Second, it's got to be something that I can see will help people. And, maybe most important, I've got to enjoy doing it.\"</p>\r\n<p>Take his involvement with the General, an insurance provider that has been around since 1963 and offers low-cost car insurance to high-risk clients, such as people who have had recent accidents. You might know the company from its low- budget TV ads with a poorly computer- animated singing \"General\"; you may have seen them while viewing an old Jerry Springer episode at 2:30 in the afternoon. When O'Neal was approached by American Family Insurance in 2015 for a potential endorsement or partnership, he discovered that the company had bought the General a few years earlier.</p>\r\n<p>\"That's what I wanted to be involved with,\" O'Neal says. \"It was the only insurance I could afford in college. I didn't know what the hell insurance was. My dad told me I had to get it for my car, and everything was 300 bucks, and I didn't have 300 bucks. So they gave me insurance for $29, full coverage. There are more regular people than there are spoiled rich people like me. The most important thing I focus on is affordability, because not everybody has the means that I have. I didn't always have all this. Most people don't.\"</p>\r\n<p>O'Neal isn't trying to impress the business elite with what's in his brand port&shy;folio. He's worried about what the brands offer customers. \"I was watching Maury Povich when I saw the commercials, too,\" he says. He legitimately cares about the General because he remembers legiti&shy;mately needing the General. It's impossible to fully measure O'Neal's halo effect on the business, but the company revamped its ad strategy in 2021 to double down on his humor and star power. Now Inside the NBA co-hosts Kenny Smith and Ernie Johnson, Jr. among other Shaq friends, appear alongside him in the ads.</p>\r\n<p>Big Chicken's origin story also draws on O'Neal's early years. Shaq grew up in New Jersey, Germany, and Texas in a strict but loving household run by his mother and his drill sergeant stepdad (his biological father was out of the picture). Some of his warmest memories involve sitting around the table after church, eating chicken, and spending time with family. It was something he always wanted to provide to others, and that notion led to his founding the restaurant chain, along with CEO Josh Halpern.</p>\r\n<p>\"One of Shaquille's top values is authenticity,\" Halpern says. \"He sought to create a concept that felt like him. He's the number-one shareholder. You go into one of our stores, and it feels like him.\" There's a sandwich named after O'Neal's bodyguard, called the Uncle Jerome, and one called the Big &amp; Sloppy, a reference to his Inside the NBA co-host Charles Barkley. That one, O'Neal jokes, \"is a sloppy sandwich for a sloppy guy.\" It's just the sort of crack he would level at Barkley on air.</p>\r\n<p>Salter notes that in many ways, Big Chicken is the ultimate encapsulation of O'Neal's brand. \"It's about value and fun,\" he says. \"Big Chicken is, at its core, what Shaq likes to eat. That's the best chicken sandwich you'll ever have, because it's his mother's recipe.\" And he keeps the price at an approachable level.</p>\r\n<!--inlineimage//-->\r\n<p>O'Neal has life stories that connect to all the businesses he has created or invested in. He invested an undisclosed amount in Ring technology because he was thinking about security for his family's home. He partnered with Authentic Brands because he wanted to make sure his family was taken care of after he died--\"like they did with Elvis.\" It might seem seat-of-the-pants--O'Neal just picking things he personally likes--but, ultimately, picking things he likes is the whole point. The brand of Shaq is nothing if not authentic.</p>\r\n<p>Put another way: It's a lot easier to succeed when you don't have to pretend to have faith in what you're doing. It's a lot easier when you care.</p>\r\n<h2>Know your limits</h2>\r\n<p>Back when O'Neal was still playing for the Los Angeles Lakers, he happened to use the same financial adviser as Starbucks founder Howard Schultz. One day in 1998, when the team was in Seattle for a game, Schultz called him. \"Shaq, do you want to do a Starbucks in the 'hood?\" he said.</p>\r\n<p>\"The way he put it kind threw me off,\" O'Neal recalls today. \"My response to him was, 'Black people don't drink coffee.' Nobody in my family drank coffee. I thought it wouldn't work. He offered me equity in the company plus 10 to 15 coffee shops starting in L.A. After I told him no, he went to Magic Johnson--and Magic got the deal.\" When Johnson sold his Starbucks stock in 2010, he made $100 million--$100 million that he poured right back in his other businesses. \"Which I would have done,\" O'Neal says with a sigh.</p>\r\n<p>That experience changed O'Neal's approach. Before the Starbucks miss, he had stuck to straight endorsement deals, wherein he simply got paid to show up and cut a commercial. After Starbucks, he pursued partnerships and equity deals--to make sure he always had a stake in any place he worked with. Even more impor&shy;tant, O'Neal says, the missed Starbucks opportunity taught him to \"make sure I've got my smart people with me at all times.\"</p>\r\n<p>One of O'Neal's greatest skills as a businessperson might well derive from his belief that he's not great at it himself: He finds people who know what they're doing and stays out of their way. With Big Chicken, he says, he knew generally what he wanted: an affordable chain restaurant with homey food that could serve as a place to gather. The details beyond that needed to be hashed out, so he found people who could do that--at a company called JRS Hospitality, which has long operated restaurants in the Las Vegas area (where the first Big Chicken was introduced). Halpern says O'Neal gets especially involved with marketing strategies and franchise sales. \"And he reaches out directly to franchisees and suppliers when we have issues,\" he adds.</p>\r\n<p>In turn, O'Neal sends all the credit right back to the team. \"Those guys are smarter than me,\" he says. \"I don't have yes people around. I trust them, and I'm there when they need me.\" He also holds them to the same standards he sets for himself. \"I don't make the same mistake twice,\" O'Neal says. \"I make sure my people know that, too.\"</p>\r\n<div class=\"pullquote\">Any company I start or get involved with, it's got to be something that I can see will help people. And I've got to enjoy doing it.</div>\r\n<p>As amusing as it might be to picture O'Neal ambling into a boardroom and sitting in a chair that's too small for him, surrounded by people half his size, he is by all accounts a regular, active participant at the board meetings of his companies. \"He's a listener,\" says Colin Smeeton, president of Authentic Brands Group West Coast and a longtime business associate of O'Neal's. \"He'll never not entertain something. He learned from that Schultz experience. He doesn't dismiss anything.\"</p>\r\n<p>And, Halpern adds, \"he asks tough questions. He's good at poking, at finding the things we haven't thought enough about, absorbing the data and information that comes at him, and making decisions based on it. It doesn't surprise me anymore.\"</p>\r\n<p>Salter tells the story of how O'Neal bugged him incessantly to acquire the shoe brand Reebok, which had sponsored him early in his basketball career but had fallen on harder times since his retirement. Adidas bought the company in 2005 and had since drained it of its unique identity. O'Neal felt strongly that the name was an underutilized asset and saw an opportu&shy;nity to give it new life, just as he'd helped do with the General. Salter thought it was a bad idea and told O'Neal so over and over. But when the opportunity finally pre&shy;sented itself in early 2022, Salter pounced, partly just to get O'Neal off his back. Since then, Reebok has released several throwback Shaq shoes and gotten sneakerheads buzzing with pop-up vintage stores in New York City and a licensing deal with DC comics. Authentic Brands' Shaq- engineered takeover of Reebok happened in March 2022, only one year ago, but the brand already enjoys a relevance it hasn't had in decades.</p>\r\n<p>\"He was, of course, right,\" Salter says. \"That's going to end up being one of the best deals I've ever made. He knew it, too. He just knew it in his gut.\"</p>\r\n<h2>Understand your value</h2>\r\n<p>In 2018, Papa Johns was in trouble. Then-Chairman and former CEO John Schnatter had been forced to resign after the company's poor financial performance the year before (which he blamed in part on kneeling NFL players) and after he'd used a racist slur during a conference call. The pizza chain's revenue took a dive throughout 2018, including a 20 percent drop in the final quarter. It was a brand in crisis.</p>\r\n<p>The company saw a potential solution in O'Neal and approached him that summer with a clear pitch: They needed someone everyone knew and loved, and all the better that he was one of the most famous Black celebrities in the country.</p>\r\n<p>O'Neal knew exactly where he stood--so he demanded part of the company in return. \"Shaq said, 'Look, we've got to give people a reason to believe in a brand again,' \" says Smeeton. \"He tells them, 'If I'm going to take this risk, if I'm going to be the first minority on your board, I want to be involved on the highest level. I want to put my money where my mouth is.' It was a huge step for him in his evolution. He started Big Chicken not long after that.\"</p>\r\n<p>O'Neal joined the Papa Johns board of directors in March 2019, and it didn't take long for him to start putting his stamp on the place. He designed a Shaq-branded pizza, called the Shaq-a-Roni, that is essentially a super-size pepperoni pizza whose sales support underserved communities. A dollar from every Shaq-a-Roni sold goes to the Papa John's Foundation, which in turn distributes the money to local organizations focused on hunger relief, reducing food waste, and other causes. O'Neal also began operating some franchises himself and showing up in Papa Johns ads. He became the most visible representation of Papa Johns. No one sees John Schnatter's face when they think of Papa Johns anymore; they see O'Neal's. By the fourth quarter of 2019, revenue was back up 3 percent. And by the third quarter of 2021, Papa Johns brought in $513 million in revenue, an all-time high. It had been just over two years since O'Neal joined.</p>\r\n<p>\"Shaquille understands how to connect with people, which has been a real asset as the board and leadership team have all worked to strengthen our brand, our culture, and our franchise system,\" says Papa Johns president and CEO Rob Lynch. \"At his core, Shaquille is an entrepreneur.\" O'Neal could have just taken a check. Instead, he understood what precisely he could bring to the company--how he could help with its recovery while doing well for himself.</p>\r\n<h2>Have fun out there</h2>\r\n<p>As O'Neal talks about this personal journey, several photographers maneuver around him taking his picture, a support staffer constantly hands him plates of food, and a makeup artist does a little touchup work around his eyes. I've caught up with O'Neal today in Atlanta while he does a daylong video shoot for Carnival Cruise Line, another of his many brand partners.</p>\r\n<p>Anyone deciding to renew their vows with their significant other on a Carnival ship this Valentine's Day was about to find that a video of Shaq would officiate the ceremony. (He's Carnival's chief fun officer.) Between stopping for photos and answering questions from a pesky reporter, O'Neal decides to loosen up the extended crew by playing his \"Get the White people in the room going\" playlist on his phone--a lineup of '90s pop songs from the likes of Ace of Base, Alanis Morissette, and Sin&eacute;ad O'Connor. (His lip-sync of \"Nothing Compares 2 U\" is really something to see.) He does his first run-through of the Carnival ad in one take, and when he's done, he leaps in the air and pumps his fist: \"Now that's how you do a f--in' commercial. One-take Shaq, baby! I've come a long way since Kazaam, right?\"</p>\r\n<p>He is, in short, having the time of his life. \"You have to let him have fun,\" Smeeton says. \"It's the only way any of this happens.\" Smeeton used to try to rein O'Neal in, but he's since learned better. He points to the star's DJ business as an example.</p>\r\n<p>O'Neal regularly travels to music festivals and clubs to play shows as DJ Diesel and cut loose in a way that you won't see in, say, the Carnival Cruise video. He doesn't turn a profit on the DJ work--flights alone sometimes cost twice what he earns for a gig, he says--but the experience provides the energy that drives everything else. \"I miss the roar of that crowd, and DJ'ing is the only thing that gives it to me,\" he says. \"I do one of those shows and I'm ready to get back to work.\"</p>\r\n<div class=\"pullquote\">I don't have yes people. I trust them. I'm there when they need me. And I don't make the same mistake twice. I make sure they know that, too.</div>\r\n<p>Smeeton argues the side gigs help the wider Shaq brand. \"I told him it would be a time suck, it would tire him out,\" he says. \"Wrong again. It's one of the smartest things he's done. He's broadened his fan base, become more relevant, in a different demographic. That's just him knowing himself, knowing what he needed.\"</p>\r\n<p>And that is essential to understanding Shaquille O'Neal. Call it the Tao of Shaq. The undeniable joy of being yourself. The reason O'Neal is seen as authentic, the reason he has navigated the changing world of celebrity endorsements and entrepreneurship, is that it's fun being Shaq, and we all want to be around people who have fun being themselves. O'Neal can come up with an idea that might sound eccentric--chicken like at my parents' place! Let me live forever like Elvis! Insurance like what I had as a kid!--but he comes at it with such genuine enthusiasm and curiosity, such irrepressible Shaqness, that it transforms into something that others believe in. At one point, he told me an idea he's been thinking about: \"gum that never loses its flavor.\" That sounds crazy to me, and I now expect O'Neal to start a com&shy;pany that makes gum that never loses its flavor. He has a way of getting people to come along with him. \"He's a unicorn,\" Smeeton says. \"There isn't anyone who doesn't want to get in a room with Shaq.\"</p>\r\n<p>In a rare down moment, I ask O'Neal what he sees as his ultimate goal. Where is this all going? What is he building? \"I've got enough money,\" he says. \"I've got enough stuff. I just want to go until I can't go no more.\" He pauses for just a second, takes a breath. \"I never panic. I see opportunities, I'm having fun. I'll go find some more, and have some more fun. That's who I am. That's all I can be.\"</p>\r\n<!--inlineimage//-->\r\n<p>Maybe O'Neal doesn't think of himself as a great entrepreneur. But what is an entrepreneur other than someone who is open and curious, who understands their own value, who is willing to look past steep odds, who assembles and empowers a team? What is an entrepreneur but someone who inspires other people to come along for the ride? What is an entrepreneur but someone who can't help but seize opportunities--and then use them to create even more?</p>","inc_code_only_text":"","baseurl":"//preview.inc.com/","inc_filelocation":"magazine/202303/will-leitch/how-shaquille-oneal-made-himself-bigger-than-ever-as-a-founder-and-investor.html","origin_filelocation":"magazine/202303/will-leitch/how-shaquille-oneal-made-himself-bigger-than-ever-as-a-founder-and-investor.html","timestamp":"","featureimage":"https://assets.inc.com/_/images/uploaded_files/image/970x450/Shaq-6LK-0262-copy_527839.jpg","lightfeatureimage":"FALSE","smallfeatureimage":"https://assets.inc.com/_/images/uploaded_files/image/640x290/Shaq-6LK-0262-copy_527839.jpg","tilefeatureimage":"https://assets.inc.com/_/images/uploaded_files/image/300x200/Shaq-6LK-0262-copy_527839.jpg","recommendedfeatureimage":"https://assets.inc.com/_/images/uploaded_files/image/284x160/Shaq-6LK-0262-copy_527839.jpg","mobileoverrideimage":"https://assets.inc.com/_/images/uploaded_files/image/100x100/Shaq-6LK-0262-copy_527839.jpg","vid_jw_identifier":"","videooverride":"","rubric":"","pubdate":"2023-03-07

@devingordonx","inc_newsletter_headline":"","inc_deck":"The mind-blowing journey of magic mushrooms, from underground taboo to founder's little helper to mental health unicorn.\n","inc_typid":"1","inc_clean_text":"<p><strong>The local time</strong> here in the cloud forest of <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/remote-work-digital-nomad-visa.html\">Costa Rica</a> is 11 a.m., and today is November 11, which means that in a little over 11 minutes, the full time and date will be 11:11:11 on 11/11--a cosmic alignment so conspicuous I can't help but feel like I've arrived in exactly the right place at exactly the right time. A resonant note of reassurance helps when you're contemplating a plateful of magic mushrooms in a circle of 10 mostly strangers and about to go on your first psychedelic journey, already far from home.</p>\n<p>As for the place itself, I'm at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://holos.global/\">Holos</a> retreat center, part wellness destination, part incubator for plant medicine startups, a sensorial staging ground for a <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/ali-donaldson/corporate-retreats-best-workplaces.html\">growing list of entrepreneurs who are building retreat programs</a> around specific themes (leadership, in our case) for specific clientele, with the help of specific psychoactive medicines. The center is perched atop a high ridgeline that peers over the Diamante Valley. When you unzip your tent flaps in the morning, you see the 600-foot Diamante Waterfall, the tallest in Costa Rica, a mile away across the valley, a slow-motion strip of alabaster painted onto the cliffside. Breathtaking. Another type of reassurance, though not strictly necessary for the therapeutic process we're about to undergo.</p>\n<p>In fact, the only reason I've come all this way is that I'd been disinvited from a psychedelic therapy retreat in upstate New York, hosted by a founder, because at least one of the guests--entrepreneurs, politicians, athletes, corporate executives, and the like--had vetoed my presence. The vote had to be unanimous for me to attend, and it's easy to understand why.</p>\n<!--inlineimage//-->\n<p>Aside from the obvious risk to your professional reputation, there's also the strong likelihood of snot-crying around people you've just met. We were about to dive into the deepest recesses of our minds and bodies with the aid of a powerful plant medicine, psilo­cybin, a hallucinogenic chemical found in scores of mushrooms that has been used in healing traditions dating back thousands of years, across multiple cultures and continents. I'd read enough Aldous Huxley and Michael Pollan to know that we would all be rendered about as vulnerable--as open--as a human can be. And let's not skip this technical detail: It remains a serious crime in the U.S. to possess psilocybin. Many people with the means and drive for transformative self-reflection are taking the risk anyway, though they may not wish to do so around someone who would be taking notes.</p>\n<p>The taboo, however, is starting to relax. Psychedelic therapy is creeping toward legitimacy--scientifically, socially, and legally--after having gone underground 50-plus years ago, when psilocybin, LSD, and peyote got added to Schedule I, the DEA's list of substances deemed to have \"no currently accepted medical use ... and a high potential for abuse.\" In January, the supervised use of psilocybin became legal in Oregon, and researchers expect that MDMA (a.k.a. ecstasy) will soon be shifted into the medical treatment column. Clinics that administer ketamine to treat depression have cropped up in New York, Chicago, Houston, and other cities. Mindbloom, an early leader in the space, adopted a telehealth model in which patients guided by a clinician over a video call take ketamine, in pill form, at home. But they have bigger plans. \"I named the company <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.mindbloom.com/?utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=PM_Search_Branded_Exact_12.2021&amp;utm_device=c&amp;utm_content=634257646790&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA3pugBhAwEiwAWFzwddqPbDYV35bv-hQb27SDyhA-gQ9IZy2kmzNLuHlu_XV25IttWxTWJRoC2scQAvD_BwE\">Mindbloom</a>, and not Ketabloom, for a reason,\" says founder and CEO Dylan Beynon. \"I thought that ketamine would be a wedge into the market to help us build out our protocols, tools, a provider network--build a brand--so that we would be prepared to add these other medicines.\"</p>\n<p>Psychedelic trips have been a form of social currency among entrepreneurs at least since Steve Jobs declared that LSD changed his life. Now a number of indicators suggest that the role of psychedelics in business, on the supply side and the demand side, is primed to take off. What that means for founders, in particular, is a wide-open question. \"How psychedelics can help facilitate leadership is still a novel thing to look at,\" says Paul F. Austin, founder of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thethirdwave.co\">Third Wave</a>, a psychedelics literacy platform. \"It's a huge thing, still largely untapped.\" His guided retreat company, Synthesis, has facilitated experiences for more than 1,000 people at sites in the Netherlands, where it's legal. \"I've always been interested in this mystical experience and showing up in a business environment more compassionate, more empathetic, with better vision,\" he says. Psychedelics can facilitate that shift, and getting people in leadership positions to embrace them, he believes, represents the greatest potential for \"lasting systemic change.\"</p>\n<p>The word psychedelic combines just two Greek words, \"mind\" and \"manifesting.\" And that's what we're here to do on this ridge in Costa Rica: manifest something in our minds. Create new neural pathways, off-ramps from the mental ruts that keep us stuck in the same old mud, making the same mistakes, being the same people who got us stuck in the first place. Scientists call this neuroplasticity, and say its effects offer the opportunity to reset our thinking.</p>\n<p>It takes more than a few minutes to eat a plate of psychedelic mushrooms, and about an hour for the psilocybin to migrate to the target serotonin receptors in the prefrontal cortex, which is why people tend to start wondering when--then if--their journey will begin. I counted eight shriveled stems on my dish, chalky white and tough to chew but not as blech as I had feared, thanks to the accompanying mound of blueberries. The clock had ticked past 11:11:11, and the 10 of us sat in sweats and jammies on mats arranged like rays off the sun, as the clouds drew a curtain around us. The medicine came on gradually at first, and then all at once, like a question mark stretching out of its stoop into an exclamation point.</p>\n<p><strong>Mushrooms, fungi, the</strong> stuff­ we've traveled all this way to­ experience, function in the world as filters, purifiers, recyclers--nature's ferrying service between life and death and back to life again. And if you read through the experiences of the mounting number of research subjects who've taken them in clinical settings, you'll notice parallels between what they do in the natural world and what they do inside our brains.</p>\n<p>Different plant medicines have different effects on different parts of the brain, and thus take you on journeys that are different, yet similar in nature. Hallucinogens, such as psilocybin and LSD, or lysergic acid diethylamide, work by binding to the serotonin 2A receptor, one of 15 in a system used to coordinate brain activity. Serotonin is the neurotransmitter targeted by an entire class of antidepressants known as SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), which make more of the stuff available for connections between neurons. The promise of psychedelics is that they do the work more efficiently, better, faster.</p>\n<p>In discussions around this type of therapy, certain medicines often get lumped in with psychedelics even though they're not. MDMA is an entactogen, a category of compounds that impact social perceptions and amplify empathy, which is one of the reasons they make people want to hug a tree, but also why researchers believe they help PTSD patients unpack traumatic memories without triggering the fight-or-flight response that proves so problematic in the nonthreatening context of everyday life. Ketamine is an anesthetic with a dissociative effect that puts users in a dream-like state and dissolves one's sense of self. It's the only one of these drugs as yet approved by the FDA.</p>\n<p>Ayahuasca, meanwhile, is a beverage--you're drinking the psychedelic component DMT, which activates the frontal cortex and areas involved in episodic memory. It comes on fast, producing powerful visions and allowing for deep introspection; like doing 10 years of therapy in a matter of hours, say the psychonauts.</p>\n<p>But let's put aside, for a moment, what psychedelics do. Whom are they for? People who are hurting, struggling to stay afloat? Or are they a beautiful new tool for the type of questing, ambitious leader who feels called upon to build companies that change the world and who might also sense the imperative to better understand their own mind--what kind of leader they will need to be, what kind of person--to shoulder that burden? Is psychedelic therapy for self-repair or self-actualization? A treatment or a brain hack? Are the compounds a medicine or a vitamin? The answer is yes. After all, the suffering soul and the visionary leader are often the same person--often at the same time.</p>\n<p>\"I'd say the reason why people are inspired by psychedelics,\" says Rick Doblin, founder of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://maps.org/start/\">MAPS</a>), the unofficial NIH of psychedelic research, \"is that it helps them change the story of their lives.\"</p>\n<p>That's certainly the case for Mona Patel. Patel launched and ran her own UX firm, Motivate Design, managing up to 50 employees and clients such as Coca-Cola and Venmo, for nearly 13 years, until she realized, with the aid of psychedelic medicine, that she was getting burned out. One of her obstacles was rooted in growing up in an immigrant Indian family of entrepreneurs. \"I thought the more I achieved, the more people loved me,\" she says. \"My relationship with achievement is part of what I'm healing through this work.\"</p>\n<p>She started down this path five years ago, experimenting with microdosing, taking 125 milligrams of psilocybin every morning. For a while it made her sleepy, but she also noticed a brightness in mood, an extra spark of creativity, a widening of her perspective. She felt it stimulating all the clarifying parts of her brain that she uses for her marketing work, and soon she graduated from microdoses to doses strong enough to send her on a hallucinogenic journey for the better part of a lazy Saturday.</p>\n<p>\"The big aha! that happens with psilocybin--if you surrender--is that you see how your ego is limiting you by keeping you safe,\" Patel says. \"So all the things you think you know, and think you believe, and think are right, get chilled out. All the voices you have in your head that you try to quiet, they lose power.\"</p>\n<!--inlineimage//-->\n<p>It's no accident that places like Holos tend to attract a certain breed of driven professionals, especially founders, whose egos power their greatest achievements but can also blind them to their faults. These are also people who are working their brains while carrying the weight of a range of mental health issues. \"Most founders and executives will tell you they suffer from insomnia, burnout, or ruminative stress and anxiety,\" says Mindbloom's Beynon. In his personal experience, and in what he's seen with his clients, psychedelics seem to reverse the gears of the negative feedback loops. \"You hear a lot of founders and creatives talk about how psychedelic medicines can have these transforma­tional benefits,\" Beynon says. \"Those same effects create massive amounts of creativity and lateral thinking, and build a lot of resili­ency, so that they can handle the day-to-day stress of building a high-growth or high-impact company.\"</p>\n<p><strong>The word of</strong> the week in the Diamante Valley is container, and the sanctity of the container is the reason why what happens at these retreats remains a mystery to outsiders. In this respect, the code of Las Vegas applies at Holos: What happens inside the container stays inside the container.</p>\n<p>Indeed, I was invited to attend this particular center--there are dozens of such places outside of U.S. jurisdiction--only after multiple Zoom calls with each facilitator, individually and in tandem, and only after agreeing to strict conditions to ensure the comfort and privacy of the other nine guests, and only then after each one offered consent.</p>\n<p>It's in this context that I've changed the names of our facilitators. I've rechristened the guide who led our group conversations and rang the bell to wake us in the morning Jared, after the character from Silicon Valley, who was also gentle, compassionate, and very tall, and who stood a bit slouched, as though he were sheepish about his height. He'd guided psychedelic journeys for executives at some of your favorite search engines, but he needs to remain anonymous, for a bit longer, because those executives might not want to be connected to these activities on LinkedIn just yet. Even many backers who have given millions to the cause won't discuss it publicly. One who declined to talk to me about her support was Alexandra Cohen, wife of Steve Cohen, the multi­billionaire hedge fund manager whose foundation funds a psychedelic research and health initiative and has donated nearly $19 million to various grantees, including $5.2 million to MAPS.</p>\n<p>Time and again during my reporting, founders would tell me every detail of their journeys, and then clam up the moment I asked to use their name. One founder in New York who runs an investment business said that he's bullish on psychedelic therapy in private--he's been a psychonaut for over 10 years--but literally cannot afford to be in public. \"My ability to be on record in an article of this nature,\" he said, \"is severely impaired by the potential for an extremely negative reaction to the fact that the person they're investing their millions of dollars with takes mushrooms.\"</p>\n<p>Beynon told me a story about a close friend of his, the founder of a company with a nine-figure valuation, who'd recently gone on his first psyche­delic retreat but was afraid to share the experience with his executive team. Then, over dinner at an offsite, the topic of psychedelic therapy came up, and the founder asked gingerly if any of his team had ever tried it. Fourteen hands went up--everyone at the table. \"He said, 'Everybody was stunned that everybody else's hand was raised,' \" says Beynon.</p>\n<!--inlineimage//-->\n<p>Still, make no mistake, Jared--real name or not--was essential to the process at Holos. He and the other three facilitators performed together like a string quartet, each blessed with a gift for arriving beside you an instant before you realized you needed them. \"They weren't invisible,\" as one guest put it, \"but it sure wasn't about them.\" Common sense called for applying the same care and scrutiny to choosing a psychedelic facilitator that one would bring to choosing, say, a back surgeon. You don't want to botch this, either.</p>\n<p>While the facilitators were getting comfortable with me, I was conducting my own screening process, seeing as how it'd be my brain in their care. Even more so than by our discussions about what I hoped to get out of this process, I was persuaded, even humbled, by the stories they told about their own journeys, particularly the three women who worked alongside Jared (I've changed their names, too). Each found strength in psychedelics to navigate riveting personal transformations.</p>\n<p>There was Sara, a former U.S. Marine, raised on a blueberry farm in rural Georgia, who was on active duty the night in September 2012 that the Taliban attacked Camp Bastion in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, killing two Americans and wounding 17 people. Her experience with sexual assault survivors in the military led to a connection with Sheryl Sandberg, which led to an inner-circle job at Facebook, which led to her getting the hell out of tech; at each step, plant medicine helped guide her way until it became her whole way. There was Deborah, whose devout Mormon past left her so desperate for answers that she nearly left this world. There was Abigail, who had her dream job as a private chef for a Bay Area family until she was home alone with their 6-year-old daughter and the little girl lay down for a nap and never woke up. The trauma of that and the sudden accidental death of her father robbed her of her passion for cooking, until plant medicine helped her heal. A trio of women who'd each used psychedelic therapy and emerged with hard-earned equanimity.</p>\n<p>I felt at ease in their care.</p>\n<p><strong>The last headline</strong> I read before we all surrendered our phones upon arrival at Holos was election day news out of Colorado about the official passage of Proposition 122, which will legalize the supervised therapeutic use of psilocybin mushrooms at state-licensed treatment centers by late 2024. Colorado was joining Oregon, which passed a similar measure in 2020 and began permitting supervised use of psychedelics on January 1, 2023. As of New Year's Day, a passport is no longer needed to go on this type of guided psilocybin journey without breaking the law; a plane ticket to Portland will do.</p>\n<p>Though Oregon's measure includes a local opt-out clause, which 25 of the state's 36 counties have already exercised--thus reducing the anticipated scope of legalization--the political momentum is unmistakable. From January 2019 through September 2022, 25 states introduced 74 pieces of legislation related to psychedelics. Colorado governor Jared Polis has appointed a Natural Medicine Advisory Board stocked with experts in mycology, medicine, public health, insurance, religion, and criminal justice reform to build a regulatory apparatus for guided journeys. Legislators in at least 10 more states, including deep-red Missouri and Montana, are introducing reform measures with bipartisan support--a remarkable swing in the politics of psychedelics due almost entirely to the mounting evidence of their therapeutic value for war veterans with severe PTSD.</p>\n<div class=\"pullquote\">I thought ketamine would be a wedge into the market to help us build a brand so we would be prepared to add these other medicines.<span class=\"credit\">--Mindbloom founder and CEO Dylan Beynon</span></div>\n<p>In the U.S. Congress, polar opposites Matt Gaetz and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have both supported research bills.</p>\n<p>The FDA designated psilo­cybin a breakthrough therapy in 2018, paving the way for a cascade of clinical trials. A record 13 studies on psilocybin were launched in 2020 alone, according to <em>Nature</em>, and the results are landing in medical journals every few months. <em>JAMA Psychiatry</em>, in August 2022, reported on a study of the use of psychedelics to treat alcoholism that found that just two doses of psilocybin, paired with psychotherapy, led to an 83 percent decline in heavy drinking among the participants. By the end of the eight-month trial, nearly half had stopped drinking entirely. <em>Nature Medicine</em>, in May 2021, reported on MDMA-assisted therapy for severe PTSD, the first Phase 3 study of its kind, in which 67 percent of the participants no longer qualified for the diagnosis just 18 weeks after treatment.</p>\n<p>The FDA's blessing of ketamine for prescription use means treatment may be covered by insurance, and MDMA is up next, with mescaline expected further down the line. Imagine--a whole new medicine cabinet with the potential to replace many of the mood-disorder pills crowding it now even though those big pharma options don't work for nearly enough people.</p>\n<p>While Doblin's MAPS may be mission-driven, others are keener for a financial upside. In this gestational period, as scientists and policymakers do their work, startups are circling, waiting to be cleared for landing. Ketamine is still priced as a luxury item; a psychiatrist-assisted starter course at early movers like Nushama, which has a psychedelic wellness center in Midtown Manhattan, or Cambridge Biotherapies in the Boston area cost around $5,000--nearly the price of a week with the company that ran our retreat at Holos. Waitlists for therapist-assisted courses are months long. Field Trip Health, a three-year-old Canadian company that trades on Canada's TSX Venture Exchange and the OTC Markets Group, has raised $96.2 million to finance dozens of high-end ketamine clinics in Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, and other North American cities. Or you can sign up for a telehealth session of ketamine with Mindbloom for $195.</p>\n<p>Further out on the horizon are syn­thetic psychedelics, or non-psychedelic psychedelics, which Stanford University's Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute described as the \"white whale\" of psychedelic medicine. That hasn't discouraged them from the hunt, not with all that VC money pouring into it. German pharma billionaire Christian Angermayer, who did mushrooms in 2014 and called it \"the single most meaningful thing I've ever done in my whole life, full stop,\" has backed two startups all the way onto the Nasdaq, including Compass Pathways, a psychedelics development company valued at $450 million, which patented its synthetic psilocybin product, COM360, in 2020. Natural or synthetic, visionary or mercenary, according to InsightAce Analytic, the psychedelic therapeutics market, worth about $3.6 billion in 2021, is projected to hit $8.3 billion by 2028.</p>\n<p>Most of these companies are years away from seeing clients, let alone real revenue, and there's a healthy portion of the academic community that believes that's for the best. The American Psychiatric Association tried to tap the brakes with a position paper it issued in July 2022, drafted by Carolyn Rodriguez of Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute, and the closing line is oddly tepid: \"There is the risk that use of psychedelics for purported clinical goals may outpace evidence-based research and regulatory approval.\" It's fair to say that ship has sailed.</p>\n<p><strong>Psychedelics can work</strong> miracles, but they're not miracle drugs--a paradox that makes sense once you've tried them, and maybe only then. They illuminate the reality that we get knocked down in life, we recover, we cruise along again, sometimes for years, and then, wham, we get knocked down again. Their psychic healing power can occur on the margins of perception, a tweaking of the dials, a slight widening of your aperture. And it might not last. It might not work at all. \"Not everybody gets better,\" Doblin says. The older we get, the more people we come to know who lose the battles with their demons; plant medicine will not save them all. That's how other medicines work too: Sometimes they don't.</p>\n<p>So let's be very clear about one thing: Psychedelic therapy requires work. For all the stories of people whose OCD simply switched off after one session of MDMA, or whose lifelong depression lifted like a veil with ketamine, or heavy drinkers going cold turkey after two psilocybin treatments, there are innumerable others whose experiences are less immediate. Profound, yes, but not instantly trans­formative.</p>\n<div class=\"pullquote tweetable\">The most impor­tant thing right now is trained therapists, but it's also the most expensive.<span class=\"credit\">--MAPS founder Rick Doblin</span></div>\n<p>At Holos, much of our work in the weeks prior to our arrival and during our first 24 hours together was focused on intentionality--one of those woo-woo terms that's really just another way of saying \"planning ahead.\" The MAPS protocol uses the term set, as in mindset--the notion of being purposeful going into the journey, talking through what you're hoping to accomplish, orienting your brain so that it gets swept off in the right direction. The intention you set is a proposed plan for your journey, written in pencil, because the medicine may have its own plans.</p>\n<p>The MAPS protocol's sister to set is setting--your surroundings. Are you in a safe environment, being supervised by someone sober with experience handling people deep-diving into their psyche?</p>\n<p>Holos certainly checked that box. Sitting on my yoga mat under the palapa during our first group conversation on our first full day, before I even knew the names of the people circled up around me, I was sharing my intention for the journey ahead--baring the details of my most personal struggles to help the medicine locate their root causes, all of which seemed to have burrowed themselves deep into my chronically achy lower back. Or maybe the roots of my pain go even deeper, back to the traumas of childhood, where all the wild things await us. Maybe I didn't want to know.</p>\n<p>I was reassured to hear that all these highly accomplished people were wrestling with things as challenging as my back, and often far less easy to pinpoint. As everyone spoke, our guides encouraged us to be flexible with our intention, to let it be shaped by what others shared in our circle. Intention-setting, I learned, works more like a suggestion box for your predosed mind than a to-do list, and if something upends you, all your carefully considered intentions will scatter to the wind, and the medicine will force you to face what's right in front of you. One aphorism of psychedelic therapy is that you get the journey you need, not the journey you want.</p>\n<p>Riding on psilocybin, your mind can and will go places unfamiliar to your consciousness, but even as the sky around us slowly darkened--the only way I could be sure time was still passing on my medicine day--I was surprised to find you can still guide it. During my nine hours under the palapa, I kept noticing how easily, how friction­lessly I could coast through my thoughts and access dormant memories, like swinging through trees. But I could also see the neuropathways that led me to them. It was as though the psilocybin had lighted a chandelier of tea candles in my brain, and all I had to do was follow the flickers.</p>\n<p>All around me, for the rest of the day and into the night, I saw people in the unmistakable throes of a life-altering something. I saw bodies pendulum from agony to exhilaration, from dance fever to heaving sobs. I caught bits of eloquent self-reflection in conversations with our guides.</p>\n<p>My own experience differed because I was there to observe and to participate, to work on myself and do my job, an unavoidable Heisenbergian paradox that was bound to impact one or the other. It was a long journey, though. Plenty of time for both.</p>\n<p><strong>It took a</strong> historic convergence of forces in science, academia, business, and politics to reach this threshold, plus what Doblin calls \"this gradual disillusionment\" with the war on drugs. \"People are more open to a nuanced perspective of psychedelics,\" Doblin says.</p>\n<p>MAPS is a massive operation, not some subterranean foraging club. It's the original psychedelics startup, really, the foundation of the movement, with reach into its every corner. MAPS consists of a research and education arm with 40 employees, and a public benefit corporation that employs 140 people, mostly neuroscientists, pharmacologists, and regulatory specialists. Pending FDA approval, the PBC is eligible for a five-year window of exclusivity to market MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD. MAPS is scaling to train 25,000 therapists over the next 10 years, treat more than 1.6 million PTSD patients, and generate income of $1 billion or more. \"The most important thing right now,\" Doblin says, \"is qualified, trained therapists. But it's also the most expensive and the most delicate.\"</p>\n<p>Until hundreds of applicants complete the 160-hour training program (tuition: around $8,000) to become official state-licensed facilitators, few are going on licensed psilocybin retreats in Oregon. It could take a year to unjam the bottleneck.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the barriers of access to a healthy guided experience will remain daunting. There's no Kayak for psilo­cybin retreats, no comparison shopping, no Google reviews. Credibility travels by word of mouth, and the underground community is filled with gold diggers, god complexes, and garden-variety flakes. It's easy to spend thousands of dollars and travel thousands of miles only to dis­cover that you're being groomed for a cult. \"I've been on the wrong end of this,\" one Holos guest told me. \"Let's say the shaman's name is Tim, and you get there and realize, 'Oh, this is the Tim Show.' \"</p>\n<p>The maturation of the psychedelic therapy industry in America will--hopefully--bring with it more credibility and transparency, focused not on groovy magic carpet rides but rather on what Michael Pollan, author of How to Change Your Mind, the new testament of the modern psychedelic movement, has called \"the betterment of well people.\" The idea carries echoes of the Esalen Institute, the famed humanistic educational retreat center known for its integral role in the Human Potential Movement of the 1960s. Holos co-founder Alex Enchin is already exploring locations in Colorado for a second retreat center that he wants to be \"the next Esalen.\"</p>\n<p>The thing is, it should never have taken this long. The notion of psychedelics as a tool for creative problem-solving goes back to the earliest days of sociological research on the compounds, in the 1940s and early 1950s, before a clinical psychologist named Timothy Leary cracked open a fault line in the social sciences with his Harvard Psilocybin Project. In 1966, on the opposite coast in Menlo Park, California, James Fadiman, a Harvard-trained psychologist, and Willis Harman, a Stanford professor of engineering, published the results of a study--FDA-approved--in which they'd gathered up dozens of brilliant people in the area including senior scientists, architects, engineers, and mathematicians, all of whom had one thing in a common: a scientific problem they'd been struggling with for three months and so far failed to solve.</p>\n<p>\"The reason we wanted them to have struggled,\" Fadiman once wrote, \"is we wanted them to have emotional blocks by this time, meaning when the client's been mad at you for three months, when you're trying to earn a living and your supervisor is saying, 'Are you making no progress?' \" And after just one dose of LSD or mescaline, which they issued interchangeably, \"the solutions rolled out with amazing regularity.\" Soon they were turning people away.</p>\n<p>But for the past half century, and really for the first time in human history, the use of psychedelics has been a serious crime. Nixon put all of it on ice when, in 1970, his administration established the Controlled Substances Act and piled psychedelics onto Schedule I, as if to kill off the counterculture by writing it into federal code. In the process, he buried the mounting scientific research that psychedelics weren't just promising medicines for the afflicted, but for all of us, because we're all a bit broken.</p>\n<p>Johns Hopkins University managed to mete out its remaining supply of psychedelics and continue its research, subsisting on crumbs, until the mid-1970s, when all those ideas about leadership and creative problem-solving--all that potential--moved underground, plodding along beneath the topsoil, not unlike a network of fungi. Then in 2020, the university launched the Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research, which was funded by a $17 million gift from the Cohens, author Tim Ferriss, WordPress co-founder Matt Mullenweg, Toms founder Blake Mycoskie, and investor Craig Nerenberg.</p>\n<p><strong>On mushroom day,</strong> shortly after dawn, while stretching on the floor of my damp tent, I slipped ever so slightly and felt the telltale spasm in my lower back that I knew meant three to five days of discomfort. Day one, today, would particularly suck. I swore at myself. My appetite fled. In the weeks leading up to the retreat, I'd felt no trepidation about it, but I'd read enough, prepared enough, to know this would impact my journey, and might even thrust it into a leading role.</p>\n<p>\"We like to say that difficult is not the same as bad,\" Doblin would tell me later. \"People have to be prepared for difficult experiences because life is difficult.\" What he's getting at, of course, is the dreaded \"bad trip,\" the specter of which might dissuade as many people from psychedelics as the lingering taboo.</p>\n<p>But what is a bad trip? A psychotic episode? Or does it just describe a journey that's way less fun than you anticipated? What if the difference between a bad trip and a therapeutic one is simply a matter of switching the labels on the bottle? \"I never went into a psychedelic trip being like, 'Oh, this is gonna be so fun,' \" says Dan Poneman, an NBA agent whose experience with psychedelics helped him build his own agency, and also know when it was time to exit. \"It's the opposite: It's like going into battle. Most of my trips would be classified as bad trips, where I would have to really fight with my shit and come out feeling better.\"</p>\n<!--inlineimage//-->\n<p>You get the journey you need, not the journey you want.</p>\n<p>Describing a psychedelic journey is a lot like sharing vacation photos--a little goes a long way.</p>\n<p>During mine, between shifting from my side to my back to my stomach to relieve my lumbar pain, I scribbled notes occasionally. I tried to keep them short to maximize the chance that any of it might make sense later. One read: \"Swimming with sharks.\"</p>\n<p>You know how, when you shut your eyes in a well-lighted room and stare at the inside of your eyelids, you can see these faint aqueous lines squiggling? It's just the light shining through the skin, illuminating a thin network of tiny veins. But on psilocybin, those squiggles look like waves or, more precisely, a swift current deep below the surface of the ocean.</p>\n<p>As soon as my thoughts turn to the ocean, they invariably turn to sharks, and when that occurred I beat the psilocybin down that tea-candle-lighted path to the childhood memory. I knew exactly where it was going: the time when I was 7 years old, and my father had us for the weekend, and we went to the movies to see Jaws 3-D. And good for him, in retrospect. All I have ever remembered from that afternoon is sitting there in my cardboard 3-D glasses, watching a severed arm drift toward my 7-year-old face. That is precisely when my lifelong terror of sharks, and by extension, the ocean--or really any body of water in which I can't see my feet--took root. I wasn't in Costa Rica to fix my shark phobia, but I went back to that night as a child, after the lights went out. Nightmare after nightmare, waking up shrieking, bleary-eyed, exhausted, my newly solo father out of his depth. And yet as formative as I knew that night was, I'd forgotten the particulars. Now it was as though the medicine was handing me a dusty box of Super 8 reels.</p>\n<p>At some point, my attention shifted back to that flowing current inside my eyelids, and a phrase popped into my head: \"Swimming with sharks.\" My brain was demanding that I consider it. Many weeks later I'm still sorting through what it means, and how it all connects to my work, my back, my family, my kids.</p>\n<p>What I think it's about, though, is how so many times in life we feel like we're being forced to jump into a vast ocean, and how it can seem like there's nothing but hungry sharks circling down there, but in reality, there's no blood in the water. They're minding their own business, dealing with their own problems, the pressure of needing to keep moving or die. We're not swimming with sharks in life, either.</p>\n<div class=\"pullquote tweetable\">In plant medicine, there's nothing more powerful than the sense of connectedness.<span class=\"credit\">--Author Keith Ferrazzi</span></div>\n<p>As night settled over the valley, the downpour around us got biblical. Booms of thunder rocked the ridgeline, and as the medicine cycled out of our systems and we sat on our mats in hazy silence sipping sweet-potato soup, I thought ahead to the next morning, and our scheduled group outing to a pair of nearby waterfalls with natural swimming holes, and how nothing could have sounded better in that exact moment to my stiff, grimy, sweaty, stinking carcass than a purifying plunge into a crisp pool of cold mountain water. Assuming, that was, my lower back would be in any condition for the steep hike down the path.</p>\n<p>Maybe it was the medicine, maybe it was all those generous huddled conversations with our virtuosic guides, or maybe I just wanted to jump into that swimming hole so desperately that I willed my muscles to surrender and unclench. All I know is, the day after mushroom day, when I woke up, my back didn't hurt anymore.</p>\n<p><strong>My first guide</strong> on this journey was Keith Ferrazzi, the Inc. contributor, best-selling creative- leadership author, entrepreneur, and human plant-medicine Rolodex. He'd offered kind reassurances before I left for Costa Rica, and it seemed only right to circle back with him after I'd unpacked everything. He'd know the answer to the question hanging over all this: What would happen if every founder in America did what I had done? His response arrived via lengthy voice memo, as is his wont:</p>\n<p>\"An entrepreneur friend of mine who was deeply affected by psilocybin said he used to live his life trying to control everything. Now he lets go and allows empowerment around him, and what's interesting is that people have stepped up and achieved more. As a result, he's actually gone higher.</p>\n<p>\"In plant medicine, there's nothing more powerful than the sense of connectedness as opposed to individualism--'I gotta do this myself.' You start to see how inter­dependency is so beautiful and brings value. And so if entrepreneurs did this work they would have much more appreciation for setting a new standard--what their team is capable of, what is possible.</p>\n<p>\"Then, of course, this breakthrough thinking would cascade into the organization and people would begin to feel this and it would cascade into families and cascade into society and cascade into the philanthropies they support and perhaps even into government. I mean, if the entrepreneurs transform what is expected, everyone's contributions would have to meet a new standard.\"</p>\n<p>It's quite a vision.</p>\n<p><strong>The healing begins,</strong> typically, when mushroom day ends. That was your adventure at sea, thrilling and stormy, punctuated by periods of elation and periods of nausea. This next part--integration, in the parlance--is where we take our wobbly first few steps back ashore, and get reaccustomed to terra firma. It's when we need our guides the most. For my group at Holos, it began the very next day, under the palapa, sharing where our journeys took us and taking our first stabs at sorting through what it all meant.</p>\n<p>Integration, when you can take advantage of that newfound neuroplasticity, continues for weeks, or at least it should. One quick way to tell if you've signed up with a company interested in your well-being is the level of resources it dedicates to this aspect of the process. My integration consisted of four hourlong Zoom calls with each of our four guides, like a series of check-ins with a therapist, each providing a fresh vantage point. Jared, Sara, Deborah, and Abigail had all seen me at the rawest I've been in my adult life, and even though I spent half of our time interviewing them, I also made more progress on myself than I ever have over years of therapy. People who go on psychedelic journeys say things like this a lot, and integration is where the real work gets done, without any drugs.</p>\n<p>One person who's seen this up close is Eric Nielsen, who's been pursuing psychedelics for healing since 2015 and founded Mission B to provide consulting to business leaders. \"I'm not saying ingesting psychedelics equals transformation,\" Nielsen says. \"There's a key step, which is getting really serious about where you're an asshole. You could do psychedelics and not do integration and become a bigger asshole, too--as blind to your blind spots as you have ever been. Yet, having done psychedelics, you'll be righteous about it. That happens.\"</p>\n<p>The focus on integration is a departure from the early days of Fadiman and Harman, when the novelty of the experimentation left little room for much consideration of what happens after they wear off. After a half-century pause, that mindset has returned in some academic quarters, where a kind of neuropsychological debate has opened up. Is it the drugs themselves doing the healing? Or do they function more like a catalyst that ripens our brains for healing, and it's the subsequent deep and often difficult personal excavation that changes us?</p>\n<p>We still don't know, but how the question gets resolved has vast implications for the shape of the future commercial psychedelics industry. If the journey turns out to be all noise and no signal, why not try to engineer out the messy, scary stuff? And once you've eliminated the painful components of a psychedelic experience, then why do we need all this (costly, time-consuming) integration? \"The ideal psychedelic treatment,\" declared a recent article out of the Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute, \"would drastically streamline this therapeutic process, reducing psychedelic therapy to nothing more than a simple, safe-to-use pill.\"</p>\n<p>The ideal psychedelic treatment. Would it be, though? I can say for my own part that upon returning home from Costa Rica, I noticed I was more deliberate about my writing process, more intentional about protecting my back, more proactive about my set and setting--things I've known for years that I needed to do, but this time, for some reason, I finally just did them. Leader­ship isn't a big theme in my work life, but maybe the medicine was helping me do a better job leading myself. That was another insight that scampered through my head under the palapa with its amazing patterned roof and the dangling flower lamp. Another clear vision of a brighter, healthier, wide-open future, an evolution in human betterment carved from the rawest of materials, as it so often is, by entrepreneurs who are willing to risk everything to get there first.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><em><strong>Correction</strong>: An earlier version of this article referred to the Nuayaca Waterfall, but it was in fact the Diamante

These founders say their remote-based assistants are the answer @aliccdonaldson ","inc_newsletter_headline":"","inc_deck":"You can save a chunk of change and get great help by broadening your horizons.","inc_typid":"1","inc_clean_text":"<p>In 2012, Craig Goodliffe<a href=\"https://www.inc.com/david-finkel/how-to-find-perfect-assistant-its-not-what-you-think.html\"> needed an assistant</a> to help him run his real estate and consulting businesses in Ogden, Utah. He posted a local ad for the job, but got a reply from a woman, Daphne, in the Philippines.</p>\n<p>The Southeast Asian nation used to be a hotbed for telemarketers. As spam calls became automated, that infrastructure shifted to <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/entrepreneurs-organization/how-virtual-assistants-enhance-productivity-empower-employees.html\">virtual assistant services</a>. Despite a 15-hour time difference, Daphne proved ready to take on any and all of Goodliffe's tasks, and quickly became his best asset. In fact, so many people in his network expressed interest in <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/david-finkel/find-perfect-virtual-assistant-in-3-easy-steps.html\">finding their own virtual assistant</a> that in 2018, Goodliffe launched a third company, Cyberbacker, to connect entrepreneurs with virtual assistance. Read on for tips on finding your own Daphne.</p>\n<h2>Use an agency</h2>\n<p>Stefano Faustini, CEO of Brand of a Leader, and his co-founder, Marina Byezhanova, hired their Philippines-based assistant, Kate, through <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/profile/outsource-access\">Outsource ­Access</a>, an Atlanta firm that made <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/power-partner-awards/2022\">Inc.'s inaugural Power Partner Awards</a> list of B2B companies. Taking this route helped them avoid the burden of international payroll. \"We don't have to worry about the tax implications,\" Faustini says. \"For us, it's just a charge on our credit card.\"</p>\n<h2>Hire like you're dating</h2>\n<p>When Worxbee founder and CEO Kenzie Biggins pairs one of her clients with a remote assis­tant, she approaches the process as a matchmaker-- in fact, she based Worxbee's matching methodology on Match.com's pairing model. \"Your executive assistant is usually your closest relationship&nbsp;besides your significant other,\" Biggins says. Her methodology assesses clients and assistants to align on soft skills--communication preferences, conflict resolution abilities, and even the gravitas needed to interact with other executives and investors.</p>\n<h2>Don't be cheap</h2>\n<p>U.S.-based assistants can make up to six figures. Goodliffe says the assistants his company provides from the Philippines typically cost about half that. But you get what you pay for, he warns, and advises entrepreneurs to work with an agency that offers fair wages and benefits like health care: \"We have people who say, 'Well, other companies can hire someone for $2 an hour.' I don't doubt it, but you won't be able to keep anybody.\"</p>","inc_code_only_text":"","baseurl":"//preview.inc.com/","inc_filelocation":"magazine/202303/ali-donaldson/need-some-help-heres-how-to-hire-a-remote-assistant.html","origin_filelocation":"magazine/202303/ali-donaldson/need-some-help-heres-how-to-hire-a-remote-assistant.html","timestamp":"","featureimage":"https://assets.inc.com/_/images/uploaded_files/image/970x450/0323_Insider_TipSheet_Chase_2_527507.jpg","lightfeatureimage":"FALSE","smallfeatureimage":"https://assets.inc.com/_/images/uploaded_files/image/640x290/0323_Insider_TipSheet_Chase_2_527507.jpg","tilefeatureimage":"https://assets.inc.com/_/images/uploaded_files/image/300x200/0323_Insider_TipSheet_Chase_2_527507.jpg","recommendedfeatureimage":"https://assets.inc.com/_/images/uploaded_files/image/284x160/0323_Insider_TipSheet_Chase_2_527507.jpg","mobileoverrideimage":"https://assets.inc.com/_/images/uploaded_files/image/100x100/0323_Insider_TipSheet_Chase_2_527507.jpg","vid_jw_identifier":"","videooverride":"","rubric":"","pubdate":"2023-03-08

@britnmorse","inc_newsletter_headline":"","inc_deck":"Non-disparagement clauses have been a standard part of severence agreements, but the NLRB says that buying silence isn't legal. ","inc_typid":"1","inc_clean_text":"<p>For years, companies have been able to demand that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.inc.com/nuala-walsh/need-to-fire-employees-10-strategies-leaders-use-to-get-it-right.html\">laid-off employees</a> agree to stay quiet about their employment in exchange for&nbsp;getting their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.inc.com/nick-hobson/severance-is-a-lesson-in-how-to-build-strong-workplaces-minus-whole-brain-implant-thing.html\">severance</a>. They are now free to say what they want about their former employer.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On February 21, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) overturned&nbsp;a 2020 ruling that allowed&nbsp;employers&nbsp;to make&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.inc.com/suzanne-lucas/whats-new-in-severance-agreements-a-lot-apparently.html\">confidentiality and non-disparagement clauses</a> a binding part of severance agreements. Companies&nbsp;can no longer ask departing employees to stay quiet about the terms of their departure, and the terms of their employment, with third parties, in order to get severance.</p>\r\n<p>In the 3-1&nbsp;decision, the board concluded that asking for such silence deters employees from exercising their statutory rights under the&nbsp;National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).&nbsp;The NLRB's decision applies to substantially all private-sector employers except for airlines, railroads, and other companies&nbsp;covered by the Railway Labor Act, notes Robert Nagle, co-chair of the labor management relations practice at Philadelphia-based&nbsp;law firm Fox Rothschild.</p>\r\n<p>The ruling doesn't apply to those with Section 7 rights (which under the NLRA&nbsp;allows employees the right to collectively band together to improve workplace conditions) such as&nbsp;independent contractors, managers, most supervisors, and public service employees.&nbsp;It does not appear that the Board's decision will retroactively invalidate severance agreements entered into before its&nbsp;recent decision. However, it is possible that the Board could deem any current&nbsp;attempt to enforce such provisions as constituting a violation of the NLRA.</p>\r\n<p>There may be some workarounds for employers, notes&nbsp;Jessica Roe, labor and employment attorney at Minneapolis-based&nbsp;Roe Law Group.&nbsp;For example, an employer can include&nbsp;a disclaimer in its agreements regarding Section 7 rights such as \"Nothing in this agreement&nbsp;is meant in any way to inhibit or restrict your Section 7 rights under the NLRA.\" In other words, such agreements may still be possible if employees know and understand their rights prior to signing.</p>\r\n<p>But&nbsp;a disclaimer alone, she notes, is not likely to be enough. Employers will need to ensure that their provisions on non-disparagement and confidentiality related to the agreement are narrow and use&nbsp;the language directed by the NLRB in this recent decision. She recommends business owners who've used non-disparagement agreements&nbsp;in the past to work with counsel to carefully craft appropriate language.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\"There&nbsp;should be a concerted effort to take a look at these agreements and make adjustments, at the least,\" says Roe. Especially because it's possible that the Board&nbsp;may&nbsp;still&nbsp;view such language as impermissible.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Multiple sources also note&nbsp;that it's very likely the February 21&nbsp;ruling will be appealed, and it is uncertain whether the decision can ultimately survive legal scrutiny. It is also likely that this rule on severance agreements may shift back to prior Board precedent, once again, if and when there is a Republican administration in Washington&nbsp;in 2024, notes Michael Schmidt, vice chair of the labor and&nbsp;employment department at law firm&nbsp;Cozen O'Connor.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In addition, it does not appear that the Board's decision will retroactively invalidate severance agreements entered into before the February 21 decision, says Schmidt. However, it is possible that the Board could deem any post-February 21 attempt to enforce such provisions as constituting a violation of the NLRA. In the meantime, if the Board determines that a particular severance agreement or larger policy with respect to a severance agreement violates the NLRA, the employer can be cited for an \"unfair labor practice,\" which subjects the company to certain monetary and injunctive remedies, notes Schmidt. The easiest way to avoid such citations all together, he adds, is to ditch the clauses.</p>","inc_code_only_text":"","baseurl":"//preview.inc.com/","inc_filelocation":"brit-morse/nlrb-ruling-laid-off-workers-stay-silent-severance.html","origin_filelocation":"brit-morse/nlrb-ruling-laid-off-workers-stay-silent-severance.html","timestamp":"","featureimage":"https://assets.inc.com/_/images/uploaded_files/image/970x450/GettyImages-1221984251_528271.jpg","lightfeatureimage":"FALSE","smallfeatureimage":"https://assets.inc.com/_/images/uploaded_files/image/640x290/GettyImages-1221984251_528271.jpg","tilefeatureimage":"https://assets.inc.com/_/images/uploaded_files/image/300x200/GettyImages-1221984251_528271.jpg","recommendedfeatureimage":"https://assets.inc.com/_/images/uploaded_files/image/284x160/GettyImages-1221984251_528271.jpg","mobileoverrideimage":"https://assets.inc.com/_/images/uploaded_files/image/100x100/GettyImages-1221984251_528271.jpg","vid_jw_identifier":"","videooverride":"","rubric":"","pubdate":"2023-03-06
